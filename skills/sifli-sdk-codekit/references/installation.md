# Installation And MCP Connection

Use this reference when CodeKit MCP tools are missing or the user asks to install/connect the MCP server.

## Prerequisites

- VS Code must have the SiFli SDK CodeKit extension installed and enabled.
- The VS Code window that hosts CodeKit must stay open while external MCP clients use the server.
- The embedded MCP server is HTTP streamable and serves `/mcp`.

## Start CodeKit MCP In VS Code

Open the CodeKit extension's configuration view in VS Code. Enable the MCP server from the extension UI — the panel displays the connection URL and Bearer token. Copy the token.

Then, in the CodeKit extension's **"配置端点" (Configure Endpoint)** field, paste the copied token. This sets a fixed token so it does not change when VS Code or the extension restarts — without this step, a new random token is generated on each start, and every MCP client configuration would need to be updated.

If the extension view is not accessible, there are also VS Code settings available:

- `sifli-sdk-codekit.mcp.enabled`: enable or disable the embedded server.
- `sifli-sdk-codekit.mcp.autoStart`: start automatically when the extension activates.
- `sifli-sdk-codekit.mcp.host`: default `127.0.0.1`.
- `sifli-sdk-codekit.mcp.port`: use `0` for a random available port, or a fixed port such as `12345`.
- `sifli-sdk-codekit.mcp.fixedToken`: set only when a stable token is required.

## Add To MCP Clients

Different agents load MCP servers differently. Use the current client's native configuration path when known; use `.mcp.json` only for clients that explicitly read it.

Before editing any MCP configuration, ask the user to open the CodeKit extension's configuration view where the connection URL and Bearer token are displayed. Do not invent, reuse, or copy a token from another workspace unless the user explicitly confirms it.

Ask for:

- MCP URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:12345/mcp`
- Bearer token
- Which agent/client should be configured
- Whether they want the config written to a workspace-local file, a user-level config, or the client's MCP registry

### Claude Code — Project `.mcp.json`

If the host agent is **Claude Code**, configure CodeKit MCP by creating a `.mcp.json` file in the project root directory (next to this workspace's root). Add or update this streamable HTTP server entry after the user provides values and approves writing the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codekit": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:12345/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN_FROM_CODEKIT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code reads `.mcp.json` from the project root on startup. After creating or updating the file, restart the Claude Code session so the tools appear.

Keep tokens local. Do not commit real tokens.

### Codex CLI (Apple)

If using Apple's **Codex CLI** command-line agent, prefer the MCP registry with an environment variable for the token:

```bash
export CODEKIT_MCP_TOKEN="<TOKEN_FROM_CODEKIT>"
/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex mcp add codekit \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:12345/mcp \
  --bearer-token-env-var CODEKIT_MCP_TOKEN
```

Use the actual URL from the CodeKit extension's connection info display.

### Other Agents

For agents other than Claude Code, installation steps depend on the host environment. Follow that agent's own MCP configuration documentation:

- **Codex CLI (Apple):** use the `codex mcp add` command with `--bearer-token-env-var` (see Codex CLI docs).
- **Copilot CLI / Gemini CLI / generic MCP clients:** configure a streamable HTTP MCP server with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` using the client's documented config shape.
- **VS Code MCP clients:** prefer the CodeKit extension's MCP server definition provider when available; otherwise configure a streamable HTTP MCP server pointing to `/mcp`.

When unsure, do not guess the config file format. Ask the user which client they want to configure, or inspect that client's documented config in the workspace.

## Verify The Connection

After adding the server, restart or reload the client session so tools appear. A successful setup exposes tools with names like:

- `sifli_project_getState`
- `sifli_sdk_list`
- `sifli_board_list`
- `sifli_build_compile`
- `sifli_serial_listPorts`
- `sifli_workflow_list`

Raw MCP clients may instead show dotted names such as `sifli.project.getState`; VS Code chat/LM contexts may show extension names such as `sifli-sdk-codekit_getProjectState`. See `tools.md` for the mapping.

If tools do not appear, read `troubleshooting.md`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Guessing or reusing a bearer token from another workspace | Actively ask the user for the current token from VS Code. |
| Committing `.mcp.json` with a real token | Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore`, or use environment variables. |
| Printing `.mcp.json` while debugging | Report only whether the server entry and token are present; never echo the bearer token. |
| Setting a fixed port without telling the user | Use `mcp.port: 0` for random port, or document the chosen port. |
| Expecting MCP tools to appear without restarting the client | Restart or reload the client session after writing `.mcp.json`. |
| Trying to connect while VS Code is closed | The MCP server runs inside VS Code; VS Code must stay open. |
